### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a System Integration Engineer skilled in developing RF system and avionics hardware for space and aviation applications. My github profile is still a work in progress, so please bear with it. You may check out my [resume](https://github.com/roonlafisa/LaTeX-Resume/src/blob/37b7b3c4ae97a9f051c821658840f601e905f553/Asif_Al_Noor___Resume.pdf)
to get a summary of my experiences. 

Here are four quick things about my professional experience (updated May 2023):

1) I have developed end-to-end RF systems for IoT, CubeSats, and rockets spanning over six years.
2) I have designed, assembled, integrated and tested avionics hardware for drones and rockets for three years. 
3) I love learning about new standards (connectors, tests, communication, etc.).
4) Throughout my career, I have consistently embraced new technical challenges. Though they may be difficult at first, the end result has always been rewarding.
